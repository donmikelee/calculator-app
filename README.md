## Overview

### About

Calculator is a simple application where you can perform basic math operations such as addition, subtraction, division and multiplication.

## My process

### Built with

- SCSS 
- Flexbox
- vanillia JavaScript


### What I learned

The calculator project helped me expand my knowledge of the practical use of JavaScript. It is true that I can write an application using the react library, but so far I am working on a solid foundation as a very good knowledge of JS in practice.


```html
<h1>Below is the code I am proud of üòÄ</h1>
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  let checkedValue = '';

const checkedInputHandler = () => {
  setInterval(() => {
    checkedValue = document.querySelector('input[name="toggle"]:checked').value;
  }, 100);
};

const changeThemeHandler = () => {
  for (let input of inputs) {
    input.addEventListener('change', function () {
      let inputValue = this.value;

      const elements = document.querySelectorAll(`.${checkedValue}`);

      elements.forEach((element) => {
        element.classList.replace(checkedValue, inputValue);
      });
    });
  }
};

window.onload = () => {
  checkedInputHandler();
  changeThemeHandler();
};

};
```

### Continued development

I will continue my learning with a frontend mentor. This is a great site that gives me ready projects to be carried out. I recommend it to any novice programmer who already has knowledge of front end programming, but needs more practice
